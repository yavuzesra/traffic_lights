# 🚦 Traffic Lights Project

This student project was developed during the **Data Engineering** course at **HES-SO Valais/Wallis** by Barbara Brandao Bessa, Emma Guignard and Esra Yavuz.

Using a **Raspberry Pi 3** and various sensors (magnetic, LEDs, etc.), we simulated real-world systems such as:

- 🚗 **Parking systems** with magnetic sensors
- 🚦 **Traffic lights** using LEDs
- 📊 **Vehicle counting** based on entry/exit signals
